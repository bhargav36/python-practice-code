Terraform code for deploying Qualys virtual scanner appliance to AWS accounts

These files are used to deploy a Qualys virtual scanner appliance and create an associated IAM role and Security group to allow the Qualys appliance to carry out scans and return scan results to the master Qualys console.

The following variables will need to be entered by the AWS account admin who runs the code:

PERSCODE - Unique value generated by the Qualys master console in order to activate the virtual scanner appliance. This code will be supplied by the InfoSec team to the account owner.

Service name - Name to be applied to the virtual scanner appliance and the security group created by the Terraform scripts. This value is to be decided by the account owner/admin running the code.

VPC ID - The VPC that the virtual scanner appliance is to be installed on. The scanner instance should be deployed in the same VPC as the instances that are to be scanned, unless VPC peering is in place between the VPC that the scan targets are hosted in and the VPC that the scanner instance is to be hosted in.

Subnet ID - The subnet that the virtual scanner appliance is to be installed on. The target subnet should have a route to the external internet, as the scanner has to be able to connect to the Qualys Cloud Platform. The target subnet should be agreed with the InfoSec team ahead of scanner deployment.
